### This is used to link your comfyui worker and runpod network volume storage 
### Configuring this, to match your network volume, will allow comfyui access
### to any models/loras/embeddings/custom_nodes/etc that are contained within 
### 
### 
### See https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/folder_paths.py
### OR https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/extra_model_paths.yaml.example
### for latest usable extra model path names

### NOTE: MAKE SURE THE PATH EXISTS IN YOUR VOLUME BEFORE YOU TRY TO MOUNT IT!
### 
### NOTE: For custom_nodes, make sure that any required modules are preinstalled
### in the image or your custom nodes will fail to mount properly!!
### See your desired custom node repo's requirements.txt file for details. 
### If there is no requirements.txt file, there are no additional modules 
### required for the nodes that specific repo's custom nodes.
